Explaination of Charge Density Visualization

	If the check box enabling the visualization is
checked, once the calculations are finished, a
new window showing a visualization of the charge density
of the current molecule will open.  The way to interpret
the graph is that the graph is showing a slice through the
volume that is parallel to the xz plane. The y axis and colors 
of the graph represent charge density values.  By using the 
scroll bar on the right, different slices can be viewed.  
The scroll bar on the bottom changes the y axis and color scale.
