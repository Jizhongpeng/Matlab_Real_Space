Creating Molecules for Use in RSDFT

Option 1:
Use the drop-down menu at the top left
to select the element of the next atom.  Input
the xyz coordinates of the atom in the 3 text boxes
to the right.  Click 'Add Atom'.  The atom will be
added to the list of atoms and will also be shown
in the molecule visualization.  The molecule visualization
can be rotated for a better view by left clicking and dragging.
If a mistake is made, select the offending atoms from the list
and click the 'Delete Selected Atom(s)' button.

Once the molecule is done, it can be saved by clicking the
'Save' button or selecting 'Save' from the file menu.
Give the molecule a name and choose the file extension to
use.  '.mat' is binary and can only be read by MATLAB, '.dat'
is a text format and can be viewed by any text editor.


Option 2:
Click the button marked 'Load' or select 'Load'
from the file menu.  Choose either '.mat' or '.dat'
extension and select a previously created molecule.
The atoms that make up the molecule will be added to
the list and visualization.
