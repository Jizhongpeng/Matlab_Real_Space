Progress Window Information

Once the 'Start' button has been clicked,
the Progress Window will open.  This window
will show the current progress being made on the
calculations in two ways.  At the bottom of the 
window will be a progress bar.  NOTE: the progress
bar determines the percentage completed by using 
the SCF error.  Because the SCF error can increase, 
the progress bar can go backwards.

The second method provides more information.
The text shows at what step the calculations are at.
It also shows the current diagonalization method and
the subsequent error.  Once the calculations are finished,
the eigenvalues and energy statistics will be printed.
